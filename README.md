Cardano Token Engineering resources for developing, understanding, and modeling design mechansims in the Cardano ecosystem.

# Background
This GitHub repo is intended to be the home for token engineering where content will be created for a wide vbariety of users, from those who aspire to learn data analytics and modeling, to those with existing analytics backgrounds, and for researchers and academics to participate and contribute to ongoing research about projects in the Cardano Ecosystem.

Token engineering is a one of the newest forms of engineering and consists of a blend of economics, computer science, game theory, and sociologic principles all intertwined to form the basis of token economies.  A token economy can be thought of as a system built around the tokenization of an item that is designed with programatic incentive mechanisms to encourage certain behaviors.  From a blockchain perspective, this could include the design parameters of a token on how it should be created, distributed, and utilized.  Understanding the desired behaviors that a token should illicit from a user would then lead to the steering of the programming of how the incentive mechanisms work.  

The goal of the Cardano Token Engineering Lab is to help:
1. Understand the nuances of the eUTXO account model that enables or restricts certain design patterns in token engineering
2. Help give Cardano-based projects a starting place to understand, contribute, and leverage information derived from the Lab
3. Build a community of like-minded thinkers, engineers, analysts, and theorists to grow this area and help make the Cardano Ecosystem stronger
4. Provide a background and starting place for aspiring token engineers of a variety of backgrounds to be able to contribute

# Modeling and Analysis
A majority of the analysis will be primarily using the Python programming language, where there are some open source Python libraries designed to model complex, dynamic systems such as token economies.  Resources will be created here to help anyone get started with learning Python, utilizing the modeling libraries available, and be able to start to contribute to the Lab.
